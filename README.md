   **TASK 2**
The task is about learning and understanding of basic functions of Numpy.I do all the steps of the tasks in separate files for better understanding.
   
   **Numpy Functions covered**
*Array creation and shape of arrays
*arange(),linspace(),eye()
*Indexing and slicing
*Array manipulation
*Vectorized Operation
*Basic statics

   **Observations**
Numpy functions are much faster and easy to use and by using them we can avaoid the loops. These functions are much easier and fast.

   **Instruction to run the code**
Download the respository.
copy and past the codes and run them to check the correctness of codes.
